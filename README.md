Libraries Used:
streamlit: A Python library for creating web applications with minimal code.
pandas: A powerful data manipulation library for working with structured data.
plotly.express: A library for creating interactive data visualizations.
cleanser: It seems to be a custom module or library for data cleansing and manipulation.
synthetic: It appears to be a custom module for generating synthetic data and working with data templates.
streamlit_extras.dataframe_explorer: A custom module for exploring and displaying dataframes in Streamlit apps.
numpy: A library for numerical operations in Python.
faker: A library for generating fake data for testing and development purposes.
langchain: It appears to be a custom module or library for interacting with AI models like OpenAI.
APIs Used:
OpenAI API: This API is used for interacting with the OpenAI GPT model for generating text based on prompts.
Google Bard API: This API is mentioned for generating text but doesn't seem to be used in the code.
Functions:
main_filter(data, user, row)

This function is used for data filtering based on user input criteria. It can filter data based on conditions like greater than, less than, equal to, and not equal to. The data parameter is the input DataFrame, user is the filtering criteria, and row is the column to filter on.

update_dataframe(data)

This function updates the global DataFrame with new data.

get_column(data)

Returns a list of column names from the DataFrame data.

get_row(data)

Returns a list of row indices from the DataFrame data.

delete_column(df, index)

Deletes a column specified by the index from the DataFrame df.

greater_lesser(data, num1, num2, col)

Filters data where the values in the specified column col are greater than num2 and less than num1.

delete_duplicate(df)

Removes duplicate rows from the DataFrame df.

drop_null(df)

Drops rows with null values in the DataFrame df.

blank(df, row)

Replaces blank values in the specified column row with NaN and then drops rows with NaN values.

export_dataframe(data, format)

Exports the DataFrame data to the specified file format (e.g., CSV, Excel, PNG, PDF, JPEG).

prompt_gpt(user_input, key)

Interacts with the OpenAI GPT model using the provided user_input prompt and API key (key) to generate text.

faker_lib()

This function appears to be a placeholder and doesn't contain any specific functionality in the code.

Other Functions:

There are other functions like to_float, to_int, to_string, delete_less, delete_equal, greater_lesser_equal, and more, which are defined but not explicitly used in the provided code. These functions might have been intended for future use or as placeholders.
